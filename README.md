# Flask: Alchemy of the four Elements

A open source collectable card game

## State of the project

The project is still in an alpha state. The development is done in german, therefore
the english content is not constently kept up to date. That said, a english version of the rules can be found [here](https://github.com/Orasund/flask/blob/master/docs/rules.md) and the cards can be printed using the [online card editor](https://orasund.github.io/flask/). The german text on the cards can be safely ignored.

## Motivation

While _Magic: The gathering_ is a very fun game, i hate the idea that your success within the game depends mostly on how much you want to spend. Thus i wanted to create a card game that can still be collected but does not (necessarily) cost money. By having a card editor, players can design and print their own cards, reducing the cost down to just the production costs.
